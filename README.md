Ford is starting to work on a new system that seeks to expose drivers to more data from their cars. To this end, a mobile development team is putting together an app that will allow drivers to access live data collected from their cars. This data will be pulled from the physical sensors on each vehicle, so an embedded systems team is building a component to gather these readings. This embedded component needs a backend to stream its data to, which is where your team comes in. You will be building a backend service to act as the glue between the mobile app and the sensors it harvests data from.
